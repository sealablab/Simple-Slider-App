# Session Handoff: Network Register Handshaking Protocol

**Date:** 2025-01-19
**Branch:** `20251118-DPD` (ready to branch to `feature/network-reg-handshake`)
**Tag:** `hw-tests-p1-working`
**Status:** Hardware P1 tests working with software workarounds
**Next Task:** Design and implement proper VHDL register handshaking protocol

---

## Executive Summary

Hardware testing revealed the fundamental issue described in `Register-gating-prompt.md`: **asynchronous network register updates create race conditions**. We've implemented software workarounds (time delays) to make tests pass, but now need to implement the **proper VHDL-based register handshaking protocol** in the shim layer.

---

## Problem Statement

### Root Cause
Network register updates via `mcc.set_control()` are **completely asynchronous** with bitstream operation. When Python code writes multiple registers sequentially:

```python
mcc.set_control(4, trig_cycles)          # CR4: timing
mcc.set_control(5, intensity_cycles)     # CR5: timing
mcc.set_control(7, cooldown_cycles)      # CR7: timing
mcc.set_control(1, 0x00000001)           # CR1: arm_enable=1
```

The FSM might see `arm_enable=1` **before** timing registers have valid values, causing:
- FSM tries to arm with zero/undefined timing → stays IDLE or goes FAULT
- Non-deterministic test failures (sometimes pass, sometimes fail)

### Current Workaround (Temporary)
Added `time.sleep(0.2)` delays in `arm_probe()` to allow register propagation before setting `arm_enable=1`. **This works but is crude and production-hostile.**

### Proper Solution Needed
Implement register handshaking at the **VHDL shim layer** to:
1. ✅ Gate register visibility until FSM is in safe state
2. ✅ Latch registers atomically
3. ✅ Validate register values before use
4. ✅ Provide fault semantics for invalid configurations

## Context Files to Review

### 1. **Problem Definition**
- **File:** `/Users/johnycsh/workspace/SimpleSliderApp/jc_prompts/20251119/Register-gating-prompt.md`
- **Why:** Original problem statement and proposed approaches
- **Key Points:**
  - T0: When to make network registers visible to L2/L3
  - T1: Reset behavior and register latching
  - T2: Fault clearing as equivalent to reset
  - Proposed: RESET → INITIALIZING → IDLE sequence

### 2. **DPD VHDL Architecture**

#### **DPD_main.vhd** (Core FSM)
- **File:** `/Users/johnycsh/workspace/SimpleSliderApp/20251118-DemoPD/VHDL/src/DPD_main.vhd`
- **Lines to focus on:**
  - **Line 120:** `signal state : std_logic_vector(5 downto 0);` - **NO INITIALIZATION** (this caused the STATE_4 bug)
  - **Lines 226-228:** Reset mechanism: `if Reset = '1' then state <= STATE_IDLE;`
  - **Lines 286-288:** Safety mechanism: `when others => next_state <= STATE_FAULT;`
  - **Lines 52-87:** State definitions and register port declarations
  - **Lines 120-153:** Internal signal declarations (where register latching would go)
  - **Lines 171-200:** FSM state machine logic (where INITIALIZING state would be added)

#### **DPD_shim.vhd** (Register Interface)
- **File:** `/Users/johnycsh/workspace/SimpleSliderApp/20251118-DemoPD/VHDL/src/DPD_shim.vhd`
- **Lines to focus on:**
  - **Line 136:** `signal global_enable : std_logic;` declaration
  - **Line 170:** `global_enable <= combine_forge_ready(forge_ready, user_enable, clk_enable, loader_done);`
  - **Line 292:** `Enable => global_enable,` passed to DPD_main
  - **Lines 38-72:** Port declarations (network registers come in here)
  - **Lines 204-264:** Register mapping to DPD_main ports
  - **Lines 268-308:** DPD_main instantiation
  - **Key insight:** This is where register gating/handshaking should be implemented

#### **forge_common_pkg.vhd** (Utility Functions)
- **File:** `/Users/johnycsh/workspace/SimpleSliderApp/20251118-DemoPD/VHDL/src/forge_common_pkg.vhd`
- **Lines to focus on:**
  - **Lines 56-79:** `combine_forge_ready()` function (controls global_enable)
  - **Lines 81-95:** `extract_forge_ready()` function
  - **Potential addition:** Could add register latching utilities here

### 3. **Hardware Test Context**

#### **Test Results (Pre-Handshaking)**
Shows non-deterministic ARM failures:
- **Run 1:** T4 PASS, T5 FAIL, T6 FAIL
- **Run 2:** T4 FAIL, T5 FAIL, T6 FAIL

#### **arm_probe() Workaround**
- **File:** `/Users/johnycsh/workspace/SimpleSliderApp/20251118-DemoPD/hardware_progressive_tests/hw_test_helpers.py`
- **Lines 179-218:** `arm_probe()` function with 200ms delay workaround
- **Line 213:** `time.sleep(0.2)` - the crude fix we want to eliminate

#### **Register Constants**
- **File:** `/Users/johnycsh/workspace/SimpleSliderApp/20251118-DemoPD/hardware_progressive_tests/hw_test_constants.py`
- **Lines 42-51:** FORGE control bit definitions
- **Lines 90-111:** Timing conversion functions

### 4. **Register Specification**
- **File:** `/Users/johnycsh/workspace/SimpleSliderApp/20251118-DemoPD/DPD-RTL.yaml`
- **Why:** Documents control register mapping (CR0-CR15)
- **Key registers:**
  - CR0[31:29]: FORGE control (forge_ready, user_enable, clk_enable)
  - CR1[3:0]: FSM control (fault_clear, auto_rearm_enable, sw_trigger, arm_enable)
  - CR2-CR3: Voltage controls
  - CR4-CR7: Timing controls (these need atomic latching)

## Proposed Approaches (from Register-gating-prompt.md)

### Option 1: Register Latching on Reset/Fault
- DPD_main latches all app_reg inputs during `Reset='1'` or `fault_clear` pulse
- **Pros:** Minimal state machine changes
- **Cons:** Only safe to update registers during reset/fault, limits flexibility

### Option 2: RESET → INITIALIZING → IDLE Sequence (RECOMMENDED)
- Add new INITIALIZING state between RESET and IDLE
- INITIALIZING state:
  - Latches all app_reg values into internal signals
  - Validates timing registers (non-zero, reasonable ranges)
  - If valid: transition to IDLE
  - If invalid: transition to FAULT
- **Pros:**
  - Clear semantics for when registers are safe to update
  - Built-in validation
  - Works with existing fault_clear recovery mechanism
  - Not timing-sensitive during startup
- **Cons:** Requires new FSM state and logic

### Option 3: Ready-for-Updates Handshake Signal
- DPD_main outputs `ready_for_updates` signal when in safe state (IDLE)
- DPD_shim gates register visibility based on `ready_for_updates`
- **Pros:** Allows updates during operation (not just initialization)
- **Cons:** More complex, requires bidirectional handshaking

---

## Design Constraints

### Must Preserve
1. **FORGE control scheme** (CR0[31:29] gating) - this works well
2. **Fault recovery mechanism** (fault_clear → FAULT → IDLE)
3. **Edge detection for control signals** (sw_trigger, fault_clear)
4. **Existing register mapping** (CR0-CR15 as documented)

### Must Fix
1. **Race condition:** FSM sees arm_enable=1 before timing registers are valid
2. **No initialization:** State signal powers up to random value (STATE_4 bug already documented)
3. **Asynchronous propagation:** No guarantee of register update ordering

### Must Not Break
1. **Hardware tests** (P1 tests should still pass after changes)
2. **CocoTB tests** (simulation tests in `cocotb_tests/`)
3. **Existing FSM semantics** (IDLE → ARMED → FIRING → COOLDOWN → IDLE)

---

## Implementation Strategy (Minimally Invasive)

### Phase 1: Add INITIALIZING State (DPD_main.vhd)
1. Add `STATE_INITIALIZING` constant (value = 5, since 0-4 are taken)
2. Modify reset logic to go to INITIALIZING instead of IDLE
3. Add internal signals for latched register values
4. INITIALIZING state logic:
   - Latch all app_reg inputs to internal signals
   - Validate timing registers > 0
   - Auto-transition to IDLE if valid, FAULT if invalid
5. Use latched signals throughout FSM instead of direct app_reg ports

### Phase 2: Initialize State Signal (DPD_main.vhd)
1. Change `signal state : std_logic_vector(5 downto 0);` to have initialization
2. Consider: `signal state : std_logic_vector(5 downto 0) := STATE_INITIALIZING;`
3. This prevents random power-up states (fixes STATE_4 bug permanently)

### Phase 3: Update Shim (DPD_shim.vhd)
1. May need to add initialization signal routing (minimal changes)
2. Ensure global_enable allows INITIALIZING → IDLE transition

### Phase 4: Test and Validate
1. Run CocoTB simulation tests
2. Run hardware P1 tests (remove time.sleep workarounds)
3. Verify non-deterministic failures are eliminated

## Key Questions to Answer

### 1. State Value Assignment
- STATE_INITIALIZING should be value 5 (next available)?
- Or reorganize: INITIALIZING=0, IDLE=1, ARMED=2, FIRING=3, COOLDOWN=4, FAULT=5?
- **Consideration:** Changing state values affects HVS encoding on OutputC
- **Recommendation:** Keep existing values, add INITIALIZING=5 for minimal impact

### 2. Validation Logic
What validations should INITIALIZING perform?
- Timing registers > 0? (prevents zero-duration pulses)
- Timing registers < MAX_VALUE? (prevents overflow)
- Voltage registers within range? (±5V = ±32768 digital)
- **Recommendation:** Start minimal - just check timing > 0

### 3. When to Re-enter INITIALIZING?
- Only on power-up/reset?
- On fault_clear (FAULT → INITIALIZING → IDLE)?
- On disarm (IDLE → INITIALIZING when registers change)?
- **Recommendation:** Only on reset and fault_clear (minimal changes)

### 4. Latched vs. Direct Registers
Which registers should be latched in INITIALIZING?
- **Must latch:** CR4, CR5, CR7 (timing - race condition source)
- **Must latch:** CR2, CR3 (voltage - consistency with timing)
- **Don't latch:** CR0 (FORGE control - needs immediate effect)
- **Don't latch:** CR1[3:1] (sw_trigger, auto_rearm, fault_clear - edge detection)
- **Do latch:** CR1[0] (arm_enable - consistency with timing)

### 5. Backward Compatibility
How to ensure existing Python code works without changes?
- **Current:** `reset_fsm_to_idle()` clears CR1-CR15, waits for IDLE
- **After change:** Should still reach IDLE, just via INITIALIZING
- **Test impact:** May need to update voltage tolerance for new state (2.5V?)

## Files That Will Need Changes

### VHDL Changes (Primary Work)
1. **DPD_main.vhd** - Add INITIALIZING state, register latching
2. **DPD_shim.vhd** - Minor changes if needed for initialization
3. **forge_common_pkg.vhd** - Potentially add latching utilities

### Python Test Changes (Cleanup)
1. **hw_test_helpers.py** - Remove time.sleep(0.2) workaround
2. **hw_test_constants.py** - Add STATE_INITIALIZING voltage mapping
3. **P1_hw_basic.py** - May need to handle new state in tests

### Documentation Changes
1. **DPD-RTL.yaml** - Document INITIALIZING state
2. **hardware_progressive_tests/README.md** - Update state machine docs
3. **Register-gating-prompt.md** - Mark as RESOLVED when complete

---

## Debugging Tips

### If INITIALIZING → IDLE Doesn't Happen
- Check `global_enable` is 1 (FORGE control enabled)
- Check `ClkEn` is 1 (clock not gated)
- Check validation logic isn't too strict (timing > 0 should be easy)
- Use `hw_test_helpers.read_fsm_state()` to observe voltage (should see 2.5V?)

### If Tests Still Fail Non-Deterministically
- INITIALIZING state didn't fully solve the problem
- May need Option 3 (ready_for_updates handshake) for runtime updates
- Check if other registers (beyond timing) also need latching

### If CocoTB Tests Fail
- State voltage encoding changed (if you renumbered states)
- Update `dpd_wrapper_constants.py` to match new state values
- Check reset behavior in testbenches (may assume IDLE immediate)

## Session Context Restoration Prompt

```
I'm continuing work on implementing a register handshaking protocol for the Demo Probe Driver (DPD) VHDL design.

**Context:**
Hardware testing revealed that asynchronous network register updates create race conditions - the FSM sometimes sees arm_enable=1 before timing registers have valid values, causing non-deterministic test failures. We've implemented a software workaround (time.sleep delays), but now need the proper VHDL solution.

**Goal:**
Implement a RESET → INITIALIZING → IDLE state sequence in DPD_main.vhd where the INITIALIZING state atomically latches and validates all timing/voltage registers before transitioning to IDLE.

**Key Files:**
- Problem definition: /Users/johnycsh/workspace/SimpleSliderApp/jc_prompts/20251119/Register-gating-prompt.md
- Session handoff: /Users/johnycsh/workspace/SimpleSliderApp/jc_prompts/20251119/Network-Register-Handshake-Session-Handoff.md
- VHDL FSM: /Users/johnycsh/workspace/SimpleSliderApp/20251118-DemoPD/VHDL/src/DPD_main.vhd
- VHDL Shim: /Users/johnycsh/workspace/SimpleSliderApp/20251118-DemoPD/VHDL/src/DPD_shim.vhd
- Test workaround: /Users/johnycsh/workspace/SimpleSliderApp/20251118-DemoPD/hardware_progressive_tests/hw_test_helpers.py (line 213)

**Branch:**
Currently on 20251118-DPD, tagged as hw-tests-p1-working. Need to create feature/network-reg-handshake branch.

**Approach:**
Minimally invasive - add INITIALIZING state (value=5), latch timing/voltage registers, validate timing>0, auto-transition to IDLE or FAULT. This solves the async register problem at the hardware level without requiring Python code changes.

Please read the session handoff document above and help me design the VHDL changes for DPD_main.vhd.
